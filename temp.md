❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without these variables being defined within the function scope or
passed as arguments. This will likely result in an error (e.g., `ReferenceError: a is not defined` or `ReferenceError: b
is not defined`).
* ❌ The function lacks input validation. It assumes `a` and `b` are numbers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if
they are not.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both inputs must be numbers.";
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The corrected code now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, resolving the original `ReferenceError`.
* ✔ Input validation is added to ensure that both `a` and `b` are numbers. If not, the function returns an error
message.
* ✔ This version is much more robust and predictable.
* ✔ Use of explicit parameters makes the function's intent and usage clear.
